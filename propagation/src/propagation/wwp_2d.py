# @date 08/11/22
# @version In progress
# @brief The core of the 2D WWP: propagates a 1D initial field with WWP in 2D.
# @details This function is the core of the 2D WWP code. It propagates a 1D initial reduced field with WWP in 2D,
# in a Cartesian environment. The output field is given in the wavelet domain for a reduced memory size. \n
# The library of propagators is computed. Then the field is propagated in the wavelet domain using this library. \n
# The refractivity is taken into account with a phase screen applied on wavelets directly.
# Same for apodisation.
#
# More details in:
# Hang Zhou, Alexandre Chabory, RÃ©mi Douvenot. A Fast Wavelet-to-Wavelet Propagation Method for the Simulation of
# Long-Range Propagation in Low Troposphere. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 2022, 70, pp.2137-2148
#
# @param[in] u_0 Initial field. Complex array of size (N_z)
# @param[in] config Class that contains the configuration. See class list for details
# @param[in] config_source Class that contains the source configuration. See class list for details
# @param[in] n_refraction Vector containing the modified refractive index n. Real array of size (N_z)
# @param[in] z_relief Vector containing the relief indices at each distance step. Real array of size (N_z)
# @param[out] wv_total Wavelet coefficients of the 3D field. Complex array of size (N_x, N_z)
# @warning Put lengths = multiple of 2^l
